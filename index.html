    <h3>Accomplisments in cs</h3>
    <p>During my 2 years in computer science I have made many little projects with html, css, scratch.Some of these projects can be seen on my github page and those include a project with the command line and another project where I re-created a website. I have many other small projects so if you want to contact me send me an email, my email will be in my socials section.</p>

<div id="Hob">
    <h3>Hobbies</h3>
    <p>I have pretty simple hobbies which include videogames, board games, building structures(with legos lol). My favorite video games are fps games because i am very good at them and i excel in games like Cold War, Warzone, Black Squad and Splitgate. My favorite board games are Chess, checkers,Battle ship, pool and Dominos. I found a love for legos so during quarantine i built many structures like a bat cave, airplane, bugatti and may more. I love to do these things whenever I can because they bring me joy during a times where joy is low for everyone </p>
